This is a simple android app which connects to the garage door bluetooth(Bluetooth Low Energy) and help open or close the door.

This can be implemented to various devices like connecting it to LEDs and turning them on or off, etc.

Strings that have to be send to the bluetooth device can be changed.

JUST GO THROUGH THE CODE.

THANK YOU
